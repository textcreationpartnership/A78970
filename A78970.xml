         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS, by Our late Proclamation bearing date the Eighteenth day of <hi>Aprill,</hi> We did declare Our gratious Pleaſure to grant Our free and generall Pardon to all Captains and Officers (not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly excepted in any of Our Proclamations and Declarations) and to all Common-Souldiers then under the Command of the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> under the Conditions and Limitations expreſſed in Our ſaid Proclamation, And that We would look upon ſuch Perſons as ſhould returne to their due obedience to Us, as upon Perſons ſeduced by the Cunning and Falſhood of the Authors of the preſent Rebellion, and that if ſuch Perſons ſhall be willing to ſerve Us, they ſhould be entertained in Our Army, Or, if they be not willing to ſerve, That they ſhould have Our Pardon and free Paſſe, Provided they would take an Oath never to take up Armes againſt Us: And whereas by certain Articles between the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and the Commanders of Our Forces in <hi>Reading</hi> concerning their marching out of that Our Towne, ſuch Perſons were excepted who had left that Rebellious Army, and betaken themſelves to Our Protection and Service in that Our Towne, and ſo were again upon the matter delivered up to thoſe whom out of Conſcience and Duty to Us they had forſaken; We have thought fit to declare, And We doe hereby declare to all the World, That We were not privy to, or in the leaſt Degree conſented to that exception, but doe hold the ſame moſt prejudiciall to Our ſervice, and derogatory from Our Honour, and We ſhould and alwaies ſhall chuſe to runne any hazard or Danger the violence or Treaſon of Our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies can threaten, or bring upon Us, rather then to withdraw or deny Our Protection to any, who being convinced in their Conſciences of their Diſloyalty to Us ſhall returne to their duty, and betake themſelves to Our ſervice. And as Wee have referred to a Court of Warre the full examination of all the particular Proceedings in the delivery of that Towne, that ſo Iuſtice may be done accordingly, ſo We doe farther declare, That We ſhall alwaies proceed with all ſeverity againſt all ſuch as ſhall by the like diſhonourable conditions expoſe Our Subjects, and bereave them of Our Protection, that have returned to their Obedience to Us. And We doe therefore once more aſſure all the Officers and Souldiers now in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt Us (except only ſuch whom by name We have excepted in any of Our Proclamations or Declarations) That if they ſhall yet within ſixe daies, after the publiſhing of this Our Proclamation, render themſelves to Our Lieutenant Generall, or to any other Principall Officer of Our Army (ſo they commit no hoſtile Act in the mean time) they ſhall receive all the Grace &amp; Favour mentioned in Our ſaid Proclamation of the Eighteenth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> as if they had obſerved the time limited in that Our Proclamation. And We doe farther aſſure all ſuch of Our good Subjects who ſhall ſo put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Our hands, that they ſhall not only receive Our Grace and Protection, but that their former Errors ſhall never be remembred in the leaſt degree to their diſadvantage. And this We promiſe in the Word of a KING.</p>
